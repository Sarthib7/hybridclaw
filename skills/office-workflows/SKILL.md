# Office Workflows

Use this skill when the task spans multiple office formats or involves both analysis and polished deliverables.

## Fresh Outputs By Default

- When the user asks for a new deliverable from a folder of source files, build it fresh from the primary inputs named by the task.
- Do not inspect or reuse older generated artifacts in that folder such as dashboards, summary files, helper scripts, or prior reports unless the user explicitly asks to update them or use them as templates.

## Recommended Patterns

- CSV/TSV -> XLSX:
  Run `node skills/xlsx/scripts/import_delimited.cjs input.csv output.xlsx --json`, validate the workbook, then polish the structure with the `xlsx` skill.
- XLSX -> PPTX summary:
  Use `delegate` in `chain` mode.
  Step 1: inspect the workbook and extract the few metrics or charts that matter.
  Step 2: build the deck with the `pptx` skill.
  Step 3: check whether `soffice`/`libreoffice` and `pdftoppm` exist:
  `sh -lc 'command -v soffice >/dev/null 2>&1 || command -v libreoffice >/dev/null 2>&1'`
  `sh -lc 'command -v pdftoppm >/dev/null 2>&1'`
  Step 4: only if both checks succeed, run the PPTX render-and-review loop on thumbnails until there are no concrete slide-level issues left. Otherwise skip that QA path silently unless the user explicitly asked for QA, export, thumbnails, validation, or render verification.
- XLSX -> DOCX memo:
  Analyze the workbook first, then draft the memo in Markdown and convert with `pandoc` or generate/edit a DOCX directly.

## Delegation Guidance

- Use `parallel` mode for independent research branches, such as "analyze workbook tabs" and "inspect brand template assets".
- Use `chain` mode when later outputs depend on prior findings.
- Keep each delegated prompt explicit about file paths, expected output, and whether the subagent should modify files or only return findings.

## Templates

- Prefer user-supplied templates from current-turn attachments or mounted workspace paths.
- For branded deliverables, inspect the template first, then preserve its structure while swapping in updated data and copy.
