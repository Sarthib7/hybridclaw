# DataLion

Use this skill for DataLion project, project-settings, data-import, codebook,
chart-table, report, report-tab, dashboard, and export workflows.

In DataLion, "tab" and "dashboard" are used interchangeably for the report
subpages managed under a report.

## Default Strategy

1. Verify the `datalion` MCP server is enabled and inspect which
   `datalion__*` tools are actually available in the current session.
2. Use MCP first for supported actions.
3. Do not invent Datalion MCP tools. If a matching tool is missing, switch to a
   REST or browser/UI path from
   [references/setup-and-capabilities.md](references/setup-and-capabilities.md).
4. Read first, write second. Restate the exact target object and proposed
   mutation before calling a write path.

## Setup

- Run HybridClaw in host sandbox mode for this local Node-based MCP server.
- Install the bridge dependencies before first use:
  `npm --prefix <path-to-your-datalion-repo>/mcp install`
- Keep `DATALION_API_TOKEN` inside MCP server config `env`, never in tracked
  files or chat.
- Use the MCP server name `datalion` so tools appear as `datalion__...`.
- For `hybridclaw gateway mcp add ...`, pass the JSON config as one quoted
  shell argument. In `zsh`, unquoted `{...}` and `[...]` will be expanded
  before HybridClaw sees them.
- See
  [references/setup-and-capabilities.md](references/setup-and-capabilities.md)
  for ready-to-paste CLI and TUI examples, dependency notes, and ability
  requirements.

## Working Rules

- Always state whether you are using MCP, REST API, or browser/UI automation.
- Resolve the exact project, report, dashboard, export, or chart before
  mutating anything.
- The current bridge directly supports project listing, project reads, project
  creation, project settings updates, data source listing, CSV upload, full
  Excel/CSV import, report list/create and tab CRUD, chart-table reads, and
  codebook list, download, generation, deletion, and upload.
- The bridge also exposes 4 browser URL helpers for project/report/dashboard
  opening and widget insertion.
- The current bridge tool surface has 22 tools total: 18 backend MCP actions
  and 4 browser URL helpers.
- Prefer `datalion__list_projects` and `datalion__read_project` before writes
  when the exact target project is not already pinned down.
- Treat `datalion__upload_data` as a data-import tool, not a generic
  project-update tool.
- Treat `datalion__edit_project` as a `defsettings` merge tool. It updates only
  the keys you pass and keeps the existing settings for all other keys.
- Use `datalion__list_data_sources` to inspect what is already loaded into a
  project before uploading or troubleshooting data.
- Prefer `datalion__import_excel_data` when the source is an `.xlsx` workbook or
  when you want Datalion's full import pipeline, including optional codebook
  generation during import.
- Use `datalion__list_codebook` when the user needs a question-level inventory;
  use `datalion__download_codebook` for the tree structure.
- For workbook imports, prefer an absolute `localPath` so the bridge can read
  the file directly.
- For uploads, confirm filename, header and delimiter assumptions, data source
  name if relevant, and whether existing rows should be truncated.
- For `import_excel_data`, confirm `projectId`, file path or base64 file
  content, filename if you are not using `localPath`, whether you want the
  default main data source (`useDefaultDataSource=true`) or a named data
  source, and whether `replaceData`, `runCalculations`, `convertComma`,
  `skipLines`, `comment`, and `createCodebook` should be enabled.
- For project settings edits, confirm the target `projectId` and the exact
  `defsettings` keys and values before calling.
- For chart-table reads, confirm `projectId`, `chartId`, and any filter string
  before calling.
- For codebook uploads, confirm `projectId`, CSV filename, import mode, and
  whether any explicit column mapping is needed. The current backend expects
  `columnMapping` as an array aligned to the CSV header order.
- For reports, prefer direct MCP coverage first.
- For dashboard and export tasks without direct MCP coverage, inspect the local
  Datalion repo and its OpenAPI or route definitions before choosing a fallback
  path.
- Keep tokens, auth headers, and exported files out of logs unless the user
  explicitly asks for them.

## Current MCP Coverage

The current `datalion` bridge exposes these direct tools:

- `datalion__list_projects`
- `datalion__read_project`
- `datalion__create_project`
- `datalion__edit_project`
- `datalion__list_data_sources`
- `datalion__upload_data`
- `datalion__import_excel_data`
- `datalion__list_reports`
- `datalion__create_report`
- `datalion__create_report_tab`
- `datalion__edit_report_tab`
- `datalion__delete_report_tab`
- `datalion__open_project_browser`
- `datalion__open_report_browser`
- `datalion__open_dashboard_browser`
- `datalion__open_add_widget_browser`
- `datalion__get_chart_table`
- `datalion__list_codebook`
- `datalion__download_codebook`
- `datalion__generate_codebook`
- `datalion__delete_codebook`
- `datalion__upload_codebook`

That means:

- project discovery and project detail reads are supported directly
- project creation is supported directly
- project settings updates through `defsettings` merges are supported directly
- project data sources can be listed directly
- CSV-style data import into an existing project is supported directly
- workbook and full-pipeline Excel/CSV import are supported directly
- the full-pipeline import path uses DataLion's datasource service rather than
  the raw CSV upload path, so it handles type detection, replace/append mode,
  optional codebook generation, and optional calculations
- report listing and report creation are supported directly
- chart tables can be read directly
- codebooks can be listed, downloaded, generated, deleted, and uploaded
  directly
- report editing beyond report-tab CRUD, dashboard editing, and export
  generation require fallback API or UI paths until the bridge grows more tools

## Common Workflows

For explicit TUI testing, prefer `/skill datalion ...`.

- `/skill datalion create a project named "MCP Smoke Test"`
- plain natural-language prompts that mention DataLion also work
- `/datalion ...` may still be routed as a normal message, but it is not a
  built-in slash-menu command, so do not use slash-menu visibility as the test
  for whether the skill is installed

### Create a Project

1. Confirm the project name and any optional `identcode` or `defsettings`.
2. Call `datalion__create_project`.
3. Return the new project ID and recommend the next step, usually data import
   or report/dashboard setup.

### Create a Report

1. Confirm the project ID and report name.
2. Call `datalion__create_report`.
3. Note that the report is seeded with a first tab and return both the report
   ID and first tab ID.

### Manage Report Tabs

1. Call `datalion__create_report_tab` to add a tab to an existing report.
2. Call `datalion__edit_report_tab` to rename or update a tab.
3. Call `datalion__delete_report_tab` to remove a tab after confirming the
   report and tab IDs.
4. Keep `projectId` aligned with the report or tab/dashboard you are mutating.

### Open In Browser

1. Use `datalion__open_project_browser` for the project screen.
2. Use `datalion__open_report_browser` for the report editor or a specific
   report tab/dashboard.
3. Use `datalion__open_dashboard_browser` for a specific tab/dashboard view.
4. Use `datalion__open_add_widget_browser` to get the modal URL used to add a
   question/widget to a tab/dashboard. The actual insertion still happens in
   the browser UI after the modal is opened.

### Find or Read a Project

1. Call `datalion__list_projects` when the user gives a fuzzy project name or
   identcode.
2. Call `datalion__read_project` once you know the `projectId`.
3. Use the returned `defsettings`, `categoriesCount`, and `dataSourcesCount` to
   guide the next step.

### Edit Project Settings

1. Confirm `projectId` and the exact `defsettings` keys to merge.
2. Call `datalion__edit_project`.
3. Return the updated keys and note that untouched settings stay as they were.

### Upload Data

1. Confirm the target project ID.
2. Call `datalion__list_data_sources` first if you need to inspect existing
   data sources.
3. Prefer CSV text input for the current bridge.
4. Call `datalion__upload_data`.
5. Return the job ID and the import assumptions you used.

### Import Excel or CSV via Datalion Pipeline

1. Confirm `projectId` and the source file path or file content.
2. Prefer `localPath` for `.xlsx` imports when the file exists on disk.
3. Use `useDefaultDataSource=true` when you want the workbook imported into
   the main project data table and codebook generation to read from that same
   table. Otherwise confirm `dataSourceName`.
4. Confirm whether `createCodebook` should run during import.
5. Call `datalion__import_excel_data`.
6. Return the data source name, imported row count, and whether codebook
   generation was requested.

### Read a Chart Table

1. Confirm `projectId`, `chartId`, and filters.
2. Call `datalion__get_chart_table`.
3. Summarize the result and surface obvious caveats.

### Codebook Workflows

1. For question-level inspection, call `datalion__list_codebook`.
2. For tree-structured inspection, call `datalion__download_codebook`.
3. For regenerate-from-data workflows, call `datalion__generate_codebook`.
4. For destructive cleanup, call `datalion__delete_codebook` and confirm
   whether `includeTextboxes` should be `true`.
5. For CSV import, call `datalion__upload_codebook` with the filename, file
   content, import mode, and any index-based `columnMapping` array that should
   align with the CSV header order.

### Reports

1. Call `datalion__list_reports` to inspect existing reports for a project.
2. Call `datalion__create_report` to create a new report once the target
   project and report name are confirmed. The new report is seeded with a
   first tab and the response includes both IDs.
3. Use the report-tab tools for tab-level create/edit/delete work.
4. Treat report edits beyond tab CRUD as fallback work until direct MCP
   coverage exists.

### Dashboards and Exports

1. Check current `datalion__*` tool coverage first.
2. If no direct tool exists, inspect `openapi.yaml`, `routes/dashboard.php`, and
   `routes/export.php` in the local Datalion checkout or use browser automation
   against the Datalion UI.
3. Prefer REST endpoints for API-backed CRUD and browser/UI paths for web-only
   export flows.
4. Be explicit about which path you chose and why.
