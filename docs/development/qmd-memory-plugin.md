# QMD Memory Plugin

HybridClaw ships an installable QMD memory plugin source at
[`plugins/qmd-memory`](../../plugins/qmd-memory).
The plugin complements the built-in SQLite session memory with external QMD
search over markdown notes, docs, and optional exported session transcripts.

## Install

1. Install QMD separately. The plugin shells out to the `qmd` CLI and does not
   embed QMD as a library.
2. Install the plugin from this repo:

   ```bash
   hybridclaw plugin install ./plugins/qmd-memory
   ```

   The plugin declares a required `qmd` executable. If neither `qmd` nor a
   configured `command` override is available, HybridClaw leaves the plugin
   disabled and reports the missing binary in `/plugin list`.

3. Reload plugins in an active session:

   ```text
   /plugin reload
   ```

## Config

Add an override in `plugins.list[]` when you want non-default behavior:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "list": [
      {
        "id": "qmd-memory",
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "searchMode": "search",
          "maxResults": 10,
          "maxSnippetChars": 600,
          "maxInjectedChars": 4000,
          "sessionExport": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported config keys:

- `command`: QMD executable to spawn. Defaults to `qmd`.
  This value is executed directly as a child process of the gateway, so treat
  it as trusted operator configuration only. Pointing it at a different binary
  lets that executable run with the same OS user and filesystem access as the
  HybridClaw gateway process.
- `workingDirectory`: directory used as the QMD process cwd. Defaults to the
  HybridClaw runtime cwd.
- `searchMode`: `search`, `vsearch`, or `query`. Defaults to `search`.
- `maxResults`: max QMD hits to format into prompt context.
- `maxSnippetChars`: per-result snippet/context cap before formatting.
- `maxInjectedChars`: total prompt context budget for injected QMD results.
- `timeoutMs`: timeout for background prompt searches and `qmd status`.
- `sessionExport`: when `true`, rewrite the current session transcript as
  markdown after each turn.
- `sessionExportDir`: optional override for transcript exports. Defaults to
  `<workingDirectory>/.hybridclaw/qmd-sessions`.

## Behavior

- Before each turn, the plugin searches QMD with the latest user message and
  injects the top matching snippets into prompt context.
- Injected QMD hits are external indexed context. They may refer to files that
  are not present in the agent workspace, so the model should answer from those
  snippets instead of treating the source path as a missing local file.
- Retrieved QMD hits are injected as a separate current-turn retrieval section,
  not as part of the generic session-memory summary.
- On search failure or missing `qmd`, the plugin logs a warning and falls back
  to no extra context.
- When `sessionExport` is enabled, HybridClaw writes one markdown file per
  session so QMD can index past conversations as a normal collection.
- Diagnostics are available through `qmd status`.
- Other QMD CLI subcommands can be passed through from the TUI or gateway, for
  example `qmd collection add .`.
- Explicit passthrough commands such as `qmd embed` run until completion rather
  than using the short background search timeout.
