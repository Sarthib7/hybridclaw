# Configuration

HybridClaw creates `~/.hybridclaw/config.json` on first run and hot-reloads
most runtime settings.

Use `hybridclaw config` to print the active runtime config,
`hybridclaw config check` to validate only the config file itself,
`hybridclaw config reload` to force an immediate in-process hot reload from
disk, and `hybridclaw config set <key> <value>` to edit an existing dotted key
path without rewriting the whole file manually.

## Runtime Files

- `~/.hybridclaw/config.json` for typed runtime config
- `~/.hybridclaw/credentials.json` for runtime secrets
- `~/.hybridclaw/codex-auth.json` for Codex OAuth state
- `~/.hybridclaw/data/hybridclaw.db` for persistent runtime data

HybridClaw does not keep runtime state in the current working directory. If
`./.env` exists, supported secrets are imported once for compatibility.

## Important Config Areas

- `container.*` for sandbox mode, resource limits, networking, and extra binds
- `observability.*` for HybridAI audit-event forwarding, ingest batching, and
  runtime status reporting
- `hybridai.baseUrl` for the HybridAI API origin; `HYBRIDAI_BASE_URL` can
  override it for the current process without rewriting `config.json`
- `hybridai.maxTokens` for the default completion output budget; the shipped
  default is `4096`
- `mcpServers.*` for Model Context Protocol servers
- `sessionReset.*` for daily and idle reset policy
- `sessionRouting.*` for DM continuity scope and linked identities
- `skills.disabled` and `skills.channelDisabled.*` for skill availability
- `plugins.list[]` for plugin overrides and config
- `adaptiveSkills.*` for skill observation, amendment staging, and rollback
- `ops.webApiToken` or `WEB_API_TOKEN` for `/chat`, `/agents`, and `/admin`
- `media.audio` for inbound audio transcription backend selection

## Security Notes

- `mcpServers.*.env` and `mcpServers.*.headers` are currently stored in plain
  text in `config.json`
- In `host` sandbox mode, the agent can access the user home directory, the
  gateway working directory, `/tmp`, and any host paths explicitly added
  through `container.binds` or `container.additionalMounts`
- keep `~/.hybridclaw/` permissions tight
- prefer low-privilege tokens
- use `host` sandbox mode for stdio MCP servers that depend on host-installed
  tools
