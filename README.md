# HybridClaw

<img width="540" height="511" alt="image" src="docs/hero.png" />

Personal AI assistant bot for Discord, powered by [HybridAI](https://hybridai.one).

## Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @hybridaione/hybridclaw
hybridclaw onboarding
```

Latest release: [v0.2.11](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/releases/tag/v0.2.11)

## Release highlights (v0.2.11)

- Added explicit cron-instruction scheduling (`at_seconds` + prompt aliases) so timer tasks are authored as clear model instructions.
- Fixed scheduler UTC parsing for legacy SQLite timestamps to prevent interval timers from firing immediately due to timezone drift.
- Added TUI proactive polling (`/api/proactive/pull`) so local `tui` reminder deliveries are surfaced reliably.

## HybridAI Advantage

- Security-focused foundation
- Enterprise-ready stack
- EU-stack compatibility
- GDPR-aligned posture
- RAG-powered retrieval
- Document-grounded responses

## Architecture

- **Gateway service** (Node.js) — shared message/command handlers, SQLite persistence (KV + semantic + knowledge graph + canonical sessions + usage events), scheduler, heartbeat, web/API, and optional Discord integration
- **TUI client** — thin client over HTTP (`/api/chat`, `/api/command`)
- **Container** (Docker, ephemeral) — HybridAI API client, sandboxed tool executor, and preinstalled browser automation runtime
- Communication via file-based IPC (input.json / output.json)

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run onboarding (also auto-runs on first `gateway`/`tui` start if API key is missing)
# On first run, it creates `.env` from `.env.example` automatically if needed.
hybridclaw onboarding

# Onboarding flow:
# 1) explicitly accept TRUST_MODEL.md (required)
# 2) choose whether to create a new account
# 3) open /register in browser (optional) and confirm in terminal
# 4) open /login?next=/admin_api_keys in browser and get an API key
# 5) paste API key (or URL containing it) back into the CLI
# 6) choose the default bot (saved to ~/.hybridclaw/config.json) and save secrets to `.env`

# Start gateway backend (default)
hybridclaw gateway

# Or run gateway in foreground in this terminal
hybridclaw gateway start --foreground

# If DISCORD_TOKEN is set, gateway auto-connects to Discord.

# Start terminal adapter (optional, in a second terminal)
hybridclaw tui

# Web chat UI (built into gateway)
# open http://127.0.0.1:9090/chat
```

Runtime model:

- `hybridclaw gateway` is the core process and should run first.
- If `DISCORD_TOKEN` is set, Discord runs inside gateway automatically.
- `hybridclaw tui` is a thin client that connects to the gateway.
- `hybridclaw gateway` and `hybridclaw tui` validate the container image at startup.
- On first run, HybridClaw automatically prepares that image (pulls a prebuilt image first, then falls back to local build if needed).
- If container setup fails, run `npm run build:container` in the project root and retry.

## Configuration

HybridClaw creates `~/.hybridclaw/config.json` on first run and hot-reloads most runtime settings.

- Start from `config.example.json` (reference).
- Runtime data is stored in `~/.hybridclaw/` by default (`config.json`, `data/hybridclaw.db`, audit/session files).
- On upgrade, legacy `./config.json` and `./data` are migrated to `~/.hybridclaw` automatically; backups are kept in `~/.hybridclaw/migration-backups/` when needed.
- Keep secrets in `.env` (`HYBRIDAI_API_KEY` required, `DISCORD_TOKEN` optional).
- Trust-model acceptance is stored in `~/.hybridclaw/config.json` under `security.*` and is required before runtime starts.
- See [TRUST_MODEL.md](./TRUST_MODEL.md) for onboarding acceptance policy and [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for technical security guidelines.
