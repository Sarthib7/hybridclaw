# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Personality switcher skill**: Added `skills/personality/SKILL.md` with `/personality` command workflow (`list`, `set`, `reset`) and a 25-profile persona set (including expert, style, and role personas like `pirate`, `noir`, `german`, `coach`, `doctor`, `soldier`, and `lawyer`).

### Changed

- **Personality persistence contract**: Standardized the managed `SOUL.md` personality block to `Name`, `Definition`, and `Rules`, so active persona behavior is fully file-driven.
- **Personality style policy**: Updated persona rules so style signals are explicitly visible for the active personality (instead of only a subset).
- **Personality skill prompt mode**: Set personality switching to command-only behavior (`always: false`, `disable-model-invocation: true`) to avoid per-turn prompt overhead while keeping `/personality` invocations available.
- **Workspace AGENTS template behavior**: Updated `templates/AGENTS.md` group-chat guidance with explicit "Quality > quantity" speaking rules and emoji-reaction social-signal policy (`React Like a Human`, one reaction per message).

### Fixed

## [0.1.24](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.24)

### Added

- **Discord edit-in-place streaming pipeline**: Added end-to-end assistant text delta streaming from container runtime to Discord delivery, including NDJSON `text` events and incremental Discord message edits.
- **Discord stream/chunk primitives**: Added `src/discord-stream.ts` (stream lifecycle manager with throttled edits and rollover) and `src/chunk.ts` (boundary-aware chunking with code-fence preservation and line limits).
- **Discord conversational event handling**: Added message debounce batching, in-flight run tracking, message edit/delete interruption handling, and thumbs-down reaction feedback capture for subsequent context.

### Changed

- **Discord reply delivery semantics**: Replaced fixed 2000-char truncation with complete multi-message delivery and chunk-safe send/edit behavior.
- **Discord responsiveness model**: Message handling now keeps typing indicators alive during long turns, updates presence while processing, and acknowledges queued work with processing reactions.
- **Discord context assembly**: Conversation turns now prepend reply-chain/thread context and include parsed attachment context (inline text/code where readable, metadata fallback for unsupported types).

### Fixed

- **Long response truncation**: Removed `.slice(0, 2000)` response truncation paths that dropped tail content and broke code blocks.
- **Perceived Discord stalls**: Fixed single-shot typing behavior by introducing a periodic typing loop for long-running turns.
- **Mid-turn user correction handling**: Edited/deleted source messages now cancel in-flight processing and clean up partial streamed output to prevent orphaned replies.
- **Screenshot reply verbosity in Discord**: Image-attachment responses now suppress workspace-path narration and default to concise delivery text (`Here it is.`/`Here they are.`).

## [0.1.23](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.23)

### Added

- **Token usage observability fields**: `model.usage` audit events now include prompt/completion/total token counts (API-reported when available, deterministic estimates as fallback), model-call counts, and char-level prompt/completion sizing.
- **Context optimization telemetry**: Added `context.optimization` audit events with history compression statistics (per-message truncation count, dropped chars/messages, and applied history budgets).

### Changed

- **Runtime-config migration logging clarity**: Startup schema normalization now logs a dedicated `normalized config schema vN` message when version is unchanged, instead of reporting a misleading `migrated ... from vN to vN`.
- **History prompt assembly**: Conversation history now applies per-message truncation plus head/tail-aware budget compression to reduce token load while preserving recent context.
- **Bootstrap file truncation strategy**: Oversized workspace context files now use head/tail truncation (70/20 split) instead of head-only clipping.
- **Prompt mode tiers**: Prompt hooks now support `full`/`minimal`/`none` modes; pre-compaction memory flush uses `minimal` mode to reduce static prompt overhead.

### Fixed

- **Local runtime-state git noise**: Added `.hybridclaw/` to `.gitignore` so container image fingerprint state files are no longer reported as untracked changes.

## [0.1.22](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.22)

### Added

- **Skills trust scanner**: Added `src/skills-guard.ts` with Hermes-derived regex threat detection (exfiltration, prompt injection, destructive ops, persistence, reverse shells, obfuscation, supply chain, credential exposure), structural checks (file count/size limits, binary blocking, symlink escape checks), and invisible-unicode detection.
- **Skill scan cache**: Added mtime-signature + content-hash scanner caching to skip re-scan on unchanged skills.
- **Extended SKILL frontmatter**: Added support for `always`, `requires.bins`, `requires.env`, and `metadata.hybridclaw.{tags,related_skills}` while preserving backward compatibility for existing fields.

### Changed

- **Skill discovery tiers**: Expanded skill discovery precedence to `extra < bundled < codex < claude < agents-personal < agents-project < workspace`, including `config.skills.extraDirs[]` and `.agents/skills` interop paths.
- **Skill prompt embedding modes**: Implemented Always/Summary/Hidden behavior via frontmatter flags (`always`, `disable-model-invocation`) with `maxAlwaysChars=10000`, `maxSkillsPromptChars=30000`, and `maxSkillsInPrompt=150`.
- **Skill eligibility gating**: Skills with unmet `requires` are now silently excluded from both prompt availability and slash-command resolution.
- **Skill slash commands**: Added command-name sanitization (32-char max), reserved built-in command blocking, and deterministic collision deduplication (`-2`, `-3`, ...), while keeping `/skill name`, `/skill:name`, and `/<name>` invocation compatibility.
- **Web tool routing guidance**: Tool descriptions and runtime prompt guidance now include explicit `web_fetch` vs browser decision rules, concrete SPA/auth/app categories, and quantified cost asymmetry.
- **web_fetch escalation signaling**: `web_fetch` now emits structured escalation hints (`javascript_required`, `spa_shell_only`, `empty_extraction`, `boilerplate_only`, `bot_blocked`) and surfaces them in tool output for browser fallback routing.
- **Browser extraction steering**: `browser_navigate` responses now include text preview metadata and explicit next-step hints (`browser_snapshot` with `mode="full"`), and docs/prompts now clarify that `browser_pdf` is export-only (not text extraction).

### Fixed

## [0.1.21](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.21)

### Added

- **Browser tool expansion**: Added `browser_vision`, `browser_get_images`, `browser_console`, and `browser_network` to the container browser toolset and subagent allowlists.
- **Frame-aware browser interactions**: Added optional `frame` targeting to browser interaction tools and exposed iframe metadata in browser snapshots.
- **Discord artifact delivery path**: Added proactive/delegation artifact propagation so generated screenshot/PDF outputs can be attached to Discord messages.

### Changed

- **Vision request payload policy**: Browser vision requests now always send a single-message payload with `enable_rag: false` and include required active request context (`baseUrl`, `apiKey`, `model`, `chatbot_id`).
- **Browser snapshot modes**: Added explicit snapshot `mode` support (`default`, `interactive`, `full`) for tighter interactive-only dumps.

### Fixed

- **Delegation attachment gap**: Resolved delegated/scheduled tool-result path that previously posted text-only proactive responses while omitting generated artifacts.
- **Bot-detection signaling**: Browser navigation responses now emit structured warning hints when known anti-bot/verification titles are detected.

## [0.1.20](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.20)

### Added

- **Browser auth policy clarification**: Added explicit runtime guidance that user-directed login/auth-flow testing is allowed with browser tools on the requested domain.

### Changed

- **Persistent browser login continuity**: Browser tooling now persists per-session profile/state by default (`AGENT_BROWSER_PROFILE` + `AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION_NAME`) with configurable overrides (`BROWSER_PERSIST_PROFILE`, `BROWSER_PERSIST_SESSION_STATE`, `BROWSER_PROFILE_ROOT`, `BROWSER_CDP_URL`).
- **Safety prompt alignment**: System safety hook now explicitly rejects fabricated “public-only/unauthenticated browser” limitations and prioritizes real tool/policy outcomes.
- **Documentation refresh**: Updated README and website docs (`docs/index.html`) with authenticated browser-flow support and browser session persistence behavior.

### Fixed

- **Audit secret leakage risk**: Structured audit tool-call arguments now redact sensitive fields (password/token/secret/etc.), including `browser_type.text`, to avoid credential plaintext in audit trails.

## [0.1.19](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.19)

### Added

- **Observability ingest exporter**: Added structured audit export to HybridAI via `POST /api/v1/agent-observability/events:batch` with cursor-based delivery, payload/event caps, and local runtime diagnostics in `GET /api/status`.
- **Observability token cache store**: Added persistent SQLite token cache (`observability_ingest_tokens`) for bot-scoped ingest tokens used by observability push.
- **Gateway admin shutdown endpoint**: Added `POST /api/admin/shutdown` for graceful local gateway termination and restart workflows.

### Changed

- **Token lifecycle flow**: Observability ingest token management now uses `POST /api/v1/agent-observability/ingest-token:ensure` (no legacy token-route compatibility paths).
- **Gateway lifecycle handling**: `hybridclaw gateway restart` and stop/restart behavior now handle managed and unmanaged gateway ownership paths more reliably.
- **Documentation refresh**: Updated README and website docs (`docs/index.html`) with observability push/token behavior, restart guidance, and operational visibility messaging.

### Fixed

- **Observability auth recovery**: Ingest auth failures now trigger token refresh attempts against the v1 ensure endpoint before pausing export.
- **Gateway status diagnostics**: Status responses now include richer observability state and PID-aware runtime diagnostics for easier troubleshooting.

## [0.1.18](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.18)

### Added

- **Forensic audit trail**: Added append-only wire logs at `data/audit/<session>/wire.jsonl` with SHA-256 hash chaining for tamper-evident immutability.
- **Structured audit storage**: Added normalized SQLite `audit_events` and `approvals` tables for searchable event history and denied-command reporting.
- **Audit verification and search CLI**: Added `hybridclaw audit recent|search|approvals|verify` command suite, including hash-chain integrity verification.
- **Instruction integrity CLI**: Added `hybridclaw audit instructions [--approve]` to verify and locally approve core instruction markdown hashes (`AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `TRUST_MODEL.md`) via `data/audit/instruction-hashes.json`.
- **TUI instruction approval gate**: Added TUI startup enforcement that blocks on unapproved instruction changes and prompts the user for interactive approval.
- **Instruction approval audit events**: Added structured `approval.request` and `approval.response` events for instruction approvals (`action=instruction:approve`) so approvals/denials appear in the audit trail.

### Changed

- **Audit command routing**: Enforced audit operations as top-level CLI commands (`hybridclaw audit ...`) and removed gateway-audit passthrough ambiguity.
- **Policy document split**: Moved onboarding acceptance policy to `TRUST_MODEL.md` and repurposed `SECURITY.md` for technical agent/runtime security guidelines.
- **Runtime safety prompt source**: Runtime safety guardrails now include the `SECURITY.md` document content directly in the system prompt.

### Fixed

## [0.1.17](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.17)

### Added

- **Push-based delegation tool**: Added `delegate` side-effect orchestration so subagent tasks auto-announce on completion without parent polling.
- **Delegation runtime manager**: Added queue-backed delegation execution with configurable concurrency, depth, and per-turn limits.
- **Proactive active-hours policy**: Added configurable active-hours gating and optional off-hours queueing for proactive outbound messages.
- **Container extension hooks**: Added runtime lifecycle hook points around model/tool execution with a built-in proactive security hook.
- **Multi-mode delegation interface**: Added `delegate` modes for `single`, `parallel`, and `chain` (with `{previous}` step interpolation), plus per-task and per-run model overrides.
- **Delegation result metadata**: Added structured delegated completion transcripts with per-task status, duration, attempts, model, and tool usage, alongside concise user-facing summaries.
- **Automatic stale container rebuild detection**: Added startup fingerprint checks for container sources so `gateway`/`tui` can rebuild the runtime image automatically when stale.

### Changed

- **Prompt hook pipeline**: Added `proactivity` hook to explicitly guide autonomous memory capture, session recall, and delegation strategy.
- **Container resilience**: HybridAI requests now use bounded exponential retry for transient API/network failures.
- **Gateway status output**: `status` now reports live delegation queue activity.
- **LLM delegation guidance**: Parent system prompt now includes a full subagent delegation playbook (when to delegate, when not to, anti-patterns, context checklist, and decomposition heuristics).
- **Subagent prompt contract**: Delegated child sessions now receive explicit role/identity constraints and a required structured final output format (`Completed`, `Files Touched`, `Key Findings`, `Issues / Limits`).
- **Depth-aware delegation capability**: Non-leaf delegated sessions can orchestrate further delegation within max depth; leaf delegates are explicitly restricted.
- **Container startup policy**: Container readiness now defaults to `if-stale` rebuild behavior and supports env override via `HYBRIDCLAW_CONTAINER_REBUILD=if-stale|always|never`.

### Fixed

- **Delegation turn-budget accounting**: Depth-rejected delegations no longer consume per-turn delegation budget, preventing false limit exhaustion.

## [0.1.16](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.16)

### Added

- **Built-in browser toolset**: Added `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_press`, `browser_scroll`, `browser_back`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_pdf`, and `browser_close` in the container runtime.
- **Browser runtime module**: Added a dedicated browser tooling layer with per-session socket isolation and normalized JSON responses for tool calls.

### Changed

- **Preinstalled browser stack in container image**: Container build now includes `agent-browser`, `playwright`, and preinstalled Chromium/headless-shell binaries for immediate browser tool availability.
- **Browser runtime hardening**: Browser subprocesses now use workspace-backed runtime/cache paths and explicit Playwright browser path wiring to avoid permission/cache issues across UID modes.
- **Docs updates**: Updated README and website docs tool catalog to include browser automation capabilities and preinstall behavior.

### Fixed

- **Browser tool startup failures**: Resolved `npm ENOENT/EACCES` and Playwright executable-missing errors observed during runtime tool execution in persistent containers.

## [0.1.15](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.15)

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- **Program creation workflow enforcement**: Implementation requests now enforce file-first behavior (write/edit on disk before response), disallow shell-based file authoring shortcuts (`heredoc`, `echo` redirects, `sed`, `awk`), and require explicit run/offer-run behavior after file changes.

## [0.1.14](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.14)

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- **Website build timeout regression**: Increased default container request timeout from `60s` to `300s` and upgraded `bash` tool execution timeouts (configurable per call) so longer build/test commands return actionable errors instead of premature timeout failures.

## [0.1.13](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.13)

### Added

### Changed

- **Release/version sync**: Bumped package and container versions to `0.1.13` after `0.1.12` npm publication.
- **Docs alignment**: Kept README/changelog aligned with the `config.json` runtime + `.env` secrets model.

### Fixed

## [0.1.12](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.12)

### Added

- **Website social metadata**: Added Open Graph and Twitter card metadata for `docs/index.html` so link previews render consistently.
- **Local favicon assets**: Added HybridAI favicon files under `docs/static/` and wired website favicon + Apple touch icon tags.

### Changed

- **Onboarding config persistence**: Default bot selection now persists to `config.json` (`hybridai.defaultChatbotId`) while `.env` is now treated as secrets-only.
- **Legacy bot-id migration**: Runtime now auto-migrates `HYBRIDAI_CHATBOT_ID` from `.env` into `config.json` when present and no configured default exists.
- **Onboarding/TUI color themes**: Added adaptive light/dark terminal palettes with readable high-contrast output on light backgrounds.

### Fixed

- **Default bot retention in onboarding**: Pressing Enter on bot selection now keeps the existing configured bot instead of silently switching to the first API bot.
- **Gateway bot guidance text**: Missing-bot errors now point to `hybridai.defaultChatbotId` in `config.json` instead of legacy env instructions.

## [0.1.11](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.11)

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- **Missing API key startup crash**: Import-time `HYBRIDAI_API_KEY` validation was moved to runtime access so `hybridclaw tui` now prints onboarding guidance instead of a stack trace when credentials are missing.

## [0.1.10](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.10)

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- **Postinstall hang during npm install**: Removed the root `postinstall` hook that could cause installs to stall.

## [0.1.9](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.9)

### Added

### Changed

- **Scoped npm install docs**: Updated docs install snippets and copy button text to use `npm install -g @hybridaione/hybridclaw`.
- **Postinstall setup flow**: Root `postinstall` now installs container dependencies and conditionally builds when source files are present.

### Fixed

## [0.1.8](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.8)

### Added

- **Live tool streaming in TUI**: Tool usage lines now stream with explicit tool names and emoji prefixes as they start, keeping operators informed during execution.

### Changed

- **TUI tool output formatting**: Tool usage output was restored with intentional indentation and compact summary replacement behavior.

### Fixed

- **Tool visibility regression**: Tool call logs are no longer swallowed into final output and are now shown at execution time.
- **Gateway startup messaging**: `hybridclaw tui` no longer prints verbose gateway logs during startup and now uses concise gateway presence/startup status messages.

## [0.1.7](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.7)

### Added

- **Live TUI tool progress streaming**: `hybridclaw tui` now displays tool execution starts as they happen via gateway streaming events.

### Changed

- **Tool output UX**: Tool lines now use a consistent jellyfish prefix and indentation, and interim tool lines are replaced with a final compact `tools` list after completion.

### Fixed

- **Tool usage visibility**: Tool calls are now shown during execution instead of only briefly at the end, so the operator sees `tool` usage flow in real time.

## [0.1.6](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.6)

### Added

- **Container image bootstrap in CLI**: `hybridclaw gateway` and `hybridclaw tui` now verify the `hybridclaw-agent` container image at startup and attempt `npm run build:container` automatically when missing.
- **User-friendly env var failures**: Startup now detects missing required environment variables and prints actionable hints instead of raw stack traces.
- **Simplified install flow**: Root `npm install` now drives container dependency setup through a dedicated setup script, so users no longer need a separate container install step in the quickstart.

### Changed

- **Onboarding runtime checks**: The CLI command flow now includes a shared container-readiness guard for startup paths, with non-interactive-friendly behavior.

## [0.1.5](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.5)

### Added

- **Explicit trust-model acceptance in onboarding**: Added a required security acceptance gate in onboarding before credentials are used, with operator confirmation token flow and policy metadata persistence.
- **Typed runtime config system**: Added `config.json` runtime configuration with schema-style normalization, safe defaults, validation, and first-run auto-generation (`config.example.json` as reference).
- **Runtime config hot reload**: Added file-watch based hot reload for runtime settings (including heartbeat/model/prompt-hook toggles) without full process restart for most knobs.
- **Security policy document**: Added `SECURITY.md` defining trust model boundaries, operator responsibilities, data handling expectations, and incident guidance.
- **Prompt hook pipeline**: Added formal prompt orchestration hooks (`bootstrap`, `memory`, `safety`) via `src/prompt-hooks.ts`.
- **MIT license**: Added a root `LICENSE` file with MIT license text.
- **HybridAI branding assets**: Added local HybridAI logo assets for landing page branding and navigation.

### Changed

- **Configuration model**: Shifted behavior/configuration defaults from env-only to typed `config.json`; `.env` now primarily carries secrets.
- **Prompt assembly architecture**: Replaced inline system-prompt composition in conversation/session-maintenance paths with the reusable hook pipeline.
- **Gateway heartbeat lifecycle**: Gateway now reacts to hot-reloaded config changes for heartbeat-relevant settings and restarts heartbeat accordingly.
- **Landing page positioning**: Refined site messaging toward enterprise value, security posture, digital coworker framing, and clearer USP comparison.
- **npm package scope**: Renamed the publish target from `hybridclaw` to `@hybridaione/hybridclaw` and set scoped publish access to public for npm organization publishing.

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.4)

### Added

- **Shared gateway protocol types**: Added `src/gateway-types.ts` to centralize gateway request/response types and command rendering helpers used by service/client layers.
- **Lint scripts**: Added `lint` scripts in both root and `container/` packages using strict TypeScript checks (`--noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`).
- **HybridAI onboarding flow**: Added interactive `hybridclaw onboarding` and automatic startup onboarding when `HYBRIDAI_API_KEY` is missing, with browser-driven account creation/login guidance, API key validation, and `.env` persistence.
- **First-run env bootstrap**: Onboarding now auto-creates `.env` from `.env.example` when `.env` is missing.

### Changed

- **Gateway-only Discord runtime**: `gateway` now starts Discord integration automatically when `DISCORD_TOKEN` is set.
- **CLI simplification**: Removed standalone `serve` command; Discord is managed by `gateway`.
- **Gateway API contract simplification**: Removed compatibility aliases/fallbacks for command and chat payloads; APIs now use the current request schema only.
- **Onboarding endpoint configuration**: Onboarding now always uses fixed HybridAI paths under `HYBRIDAI_BASE_URL` (`/register`, `/verify_code`, `/admin_api_keys`) without separate endpoint env overrides.
- **Onboarding prompt UX polish**: Registration/login prompts are now single-line and non-indented, with clearer icon mapping by step (`⚙️` setup/meta, `👤` registration/account choice, `🔒` authentication, `🔑` API key input, `⌨️` bot selection, `🪼` bot list title).
- **Onboarding login flow cleanup**: Removed the redundant standalone API key page info line and kept the browser-driven auth/key retrieval flow focused on one prompt per action.

### Removed

- **Legacy workspace migration shim**: Removed old session-workspace migration path handling from IPC bootstrap code.
- **Unused health helper**: Removed unused `getUptime()` export from `src/health.ts`.

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.3)

### Added

- **Gateway-first runtime**: Added dedicated gateway entrypoint (`src/gateway.ts`) and shared gateway service layer (`src/gateway-service.ts`) to centralize chat handling, commands, persistence, scheduler, and heartbeat.
- **Gateway client module**: Added reusable HTTP client (`src/gateway-client.ts`) for thin adapters to call gateway APIs.
- **Web chat interface**: Added `/chat` UI (`site/chat.html`) with session history, new conversation flow, empty-state CTA, and in-chat thinking indicator.
- **Gateway HTTP API surface**: Added `/api/status`, `/api/history`, `/api/chat`, and `/api/command` endpoints with optional bearer auth and localhost-only fallback.

### Changed

- **Adapters simplified**: Discord (`serve`) and TUI now operate as thin gateway clients instead of hosting core runtime logic locally.
- **CLI and scripts**: Updated command descriptions and npm scripts so `gateway` is the primary runtime (`dev`/`start` now launch gateway).
- **Gateway HTTP server role**: `src/health.ts` now serves health, API routes, and static web assets.
- **Configuration and docs**: Added gateway-related env vars (`HEALTH_HOST`, `WEB_API_TOKEN`, `GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `GATEWAY_API_TOKEN`) and updated `.env.example`/`README.md`.

### Fixed

- **TUI startup branding**: Restored the ASCII art startup logo in the TUI banner.

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.2)

### Added

- **Memory tool**: Added a new `memory` container tool with actions (`read`, `append`, `write`, `replace`, `remove`, `list`, `search`) for durable workspace memory files: `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Session search summaries**: Added a `session_search` tool that searches historical transcript archives and returns ranked per-session summaries with key matching snippets
- **Automatic transcript archiving**: Host now mirrors conversation turns into `<agent workspace>/.session-transcripts/*.jsonl` for long-term search and summarization
- **Session compaction module**: Added automatic conversation compaction with persisted session summaries and DB metadata (`session_summary`, `summary_updated_at`, `compaction_count`, `memory_flush_at`)
- **Pre-compaction memory flush**: Added a pre-compaction flush turn that runs with `memory`-only tool access to persist durable notes before old turns are summarized/pruned

### Changed

- **Prompt context assembly**: Discord, TUI, and heartbeat sessions now inject persisted `session_summary` context into the system prompt alongside bootstrap files and skills
- **Compaction execution model**: Discord and TUI now run compaction in the background after sending the assistant reply, preserving responsive UX
- **Configuration surface**: Added new `.env` knobs for compaction and pre-compaction flush thresholds/limits (`SESSION_COMPACTION_*`, `PRE_COMPACTION_MEMORY_FLUSH_*`)
- **Container runtime toolchain**: Agent container image now includes `python3`, `pip`, and `uv` in addition to existing `git`, `node`, and `npm` tooling

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.1)

### Added

- **Skills system**: `SKILL.md`-compatible discovery with multi-source loading (managed `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, project `skills/`, agent workspace `skills/`) and precedence-based resolution
- **Skill invocation**: Explicit `/skill <name>`, `/skill:<name>`, and `/<name>` slash-command support with automatic SKILL.md body expansion
- **Skill syncing**: Non-workspace skills are mirrored into the agent workspace so the container can read them via `/workspace/...` paths
- **Read tool pagination**: `offset` and `limit` parameters for reading large files, with line/byte truncation limits (2000 lines / 50KB) and continuation hints
- **TUI `/skill` command**: Help text and pass-through for skill invocations in the terminal UI
- **Example skills**: `repo-orientation` and `current-time` skills in `skills/`
- **Tool progress events**: Live tool execution updates streamed to Discord and TUI via stderr parsing, with a typed `ToolProgressEvent` pipeline from container runner to UI layers

### Changed

- **Container iteration limit**: Increased `MAX_ITERATIONS` from 12 to 20
- **Skills prompt format**: Switched from inline skill content to compact XML metadata; model now reads SKILL.md on demand via `read` tool
- **TUI unknown slash commands**: Unrecognized `/` commands now fall through to the message processor instead of printing an error, enabling direct `/<skill-name>` invocation
- **Read tool**: Replaced simple `abbreviate()` output with structured truncation including byte-size awareness and user-friendly continuation messages
- **Path safety**: `safeJoin` now throws on workspace-escape attempts instead of silently resolving
- **Tool progress UX**: Progress behavior is now built-in (no env toggles), Discord uses `🦞 running ...`, and TUI shows one transient line per tool invocation that is cleared after completion so only the final `🦞 tools: ...` summary remains
- **TUI interrupt UX**: `ESC`, `/stop`, and `/abort` now interrupt the active run and return control to the prompt; abort propagates through the host/container pipeline and stops the active container request promptly

### Fixed

- **Skill invocation in history**: Last user message in conversation history is now expanded for skill invocations, ensuring replayed context includes skill instructions
